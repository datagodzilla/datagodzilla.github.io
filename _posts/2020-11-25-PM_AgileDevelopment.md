#### Project Kickoff
During the kickoff, the stakeholders document business processes, products, and deliverables that are critical for high-quality data. They also document critical data, systems that support business processes and outcomes, and the known data quality issues. The group reviews the data quality project approach and identifies key phase deliverables and roles. The kickoff concludes with a discussion of roles and responsibilities and management routines.
