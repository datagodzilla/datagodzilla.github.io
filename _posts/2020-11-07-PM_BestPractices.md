### Introduction

It is important to develop practices at work that increase effectiveness of communication and add value to the projects.


### Writing concise and clear emails

- Intent
        - Clearly state what response or action you are expecting from the recipient
- Keep it Simple
    - Keep it brief, simple and consise to the point that a 5th grader can understand them.
- Email vs meeting
    - Emails with brevity to send out minutes and use attachments and meetings to discuss content and detailed information.
    - Understand when to share content via emails vs call for meeting.
- Tables and Charts
    - Use tables with numbers or charts that help getting the statistics across.
 Interpersonal skills

- Give importance to active listening and understand stakeholder's requirements and pain points that need to prioritized and resolved.


### Preparation

- Anticipate points of contention, possible flash points, difficult to please stakeholders, flawed arguments, historical precedents and other relevant information.
- This homework is helpful to provide confidence to stakeholders who see that the analyst has 'thought this thing through'.


### Product and Solution Confidence

- It is important to have general product knowledge as well as knowledge of the proposed solution and the conviction that it is well-suited to requirements of the moment.


### Collaboration and Team work

 - Seek help from project team members with deeper expertise to get intransigent end users and stakeholders accept to the proposed solutions.


### Documentation

- Record why actions to meet customer's requirements have not worked out.
- Run validation scenarios to review information by asking questions like
    - Is it true?
    - What conclusion does the data support?
    - Is it a real or imaginary need?
    - What trends do the historical data point to?
    - What is the use case?


### Strategic thinking and Visioning

 - The lack of clarity and structure on projects breeds ambiguity. Managing ambiguity by providing clarity where none exists is a key skill to acquire.


### Meeting Expectations

 - The stakeholders expect the Business Analyst to be running toward the fire and quickly put it out, not just narrow how hot or colorful it is. A Business Analyst who builds a track record of putting out fires is going to be in high demand given the challenges that plague the project.


### Approach to Solving Problems

- Check if there is clarity of thought that identifies the problem
- What strategies are in place for locking down the source of the problem or why is there a recurrence of the problem?
- Removing confirmation bias when evaluating data and solutions to problems gives an opportunity to consider a wide range of conclusions from the data as well as alternative solutions.
- Manage Analysis Paralysis which means overanalyzing and overthinking a problem that eventually creates paralysis and the problem does not get solved.
