### Introduction

Agile Governance under the umbrella of Agile Manifesto promotes light and simple governance structure. The Agile Manifesto is where we get the four (4) paired values and twelve (12) principles that guide Agile teams. The Agile Manifesto really can help guide us to better software development and can be used in non-software teams as well.

### The Four Values of Agile Manifesto 

The Four Values of The Agile Manifesto
The Agile Manifesto is comprised of four foundational values and 12 supporting principles which lead the Agile approach to software development. Each Agile methodology applies the four values in different ways, but all of them rely on them to guide the development and delivery of high-quality, working software.

1. Individuals and Interactions Over Processes and Tools
The first value in the Agile Manifesto is “Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.” Valuing people more highly than processes or tools is easy to understand because it is the people who respond to business needs and drive the development process. If the process or the tools drive development, the team is less responsive to change and less likely to meet customer needs. Communication is an example of the difference between valuing individuals versus process. In the case of individuals, communication is fluid and happens when a need arises. In the case of process, communication is scheduled and requires specific content.

2. Working Software Over Comprehensive Documentation
Historically, enormous amounts of time were spent on documenting the product for development and ultimate delivery. Technical specifications, technical requirements, technical prospectus, interface design documents, test plans, documentation plans, and approvals required for each. The list was extensive and was a cause for the long delays in development. Agile does not eliminate documentation, but it streamlines it in a form that gives the developer what is needed to do the work without getting bogged down in minutiae. Agile documents requirements as user stories, which are sufficient for a software developer to begin the task of building a new function.
The Agile Manifesto values documentation, but it values working software more.

3. Customer Collaboration Over Contract Negotiation
Negotiation is the period when the customer and the product manager work out the details of a delivery, with points along the way where the details may be renegotiated. Collaboration is a different creature entirely. With development models such as Waterfall, customers negotiate the requirements for the product, often in great detail, prior to any work starting. This meant the customer was involved in the process of development before development began and after it was completed, but not during the process. The Agile Manifesto describes a customer who is engaged and collaborates throughout the development process, making. This makes it far easier for development to meet their needs of the customer. Agile methods may include the customer at intervals for periodic demos, but a project could just as easily have an end-user as a daily part of the team and attending all meetings, ensuring the product meets the business needs of the customer.

4. Responding to Change Over Following a Plan
Traditional software development regarded change as an expense, so it was to be avoided. The intention was to develop detailed, elaborate plans, with a defined set of features and with everything, generally, having as high a priority as everything else, and with a large number of many dependencies on delivering in a certain order so that the team can work on the next piece of the puzzle.


### The Twelve Principles of Agile Manifesto

1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.

3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.

8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

10. Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.

11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts
its behavior accordingly.

### Agile Governance

Effective Agile Governance is about making decisions.
In order to enable effective Agile governance, the following needs to be kept in mind:

- Tolerances are essential for Agile Governance.
- Decentralized decision making empowers the team. This is critical for teams to:
    - Openly communicate and resolve conflicts 
    - Promote constructive debates on issues
    - Help quick resolution of issues
    - All team members commit to decisions and work collectively towards the project goals
- Agile Governance delivers goodwill and trust.
    - When done right, agile governance provides clarity on roles and responsibilities of team members
    - Thresholds and tolerances for decentralized decisions
- Agile promotes light and simple governance.
    - Team members decide on transparent metrics to leverage on self-monitoring the progress of the project 
    - Assessment of progress is determined through observation and engagement of team members rather than reports and documents
- Strategic and long-term Decisions remain centralized.
    - The choice of centralized vs decentralized decision making on issues remain on the following criteria:
        - Centralized decision making
            - Decisions that span a longer time frame
            - Decisions that have an organization-wide impact
            - Rare decisions that require deeper analysis
        - Decentralized decision making
            - To address regular or frequent decisions
            - Time critical decisions that should not be delayed due to significant costs
            - Need specific local or team level information or context for problem solving
- Effective Agile governance ensures decisions are made in a simpler and lighter manner per the Agile Manifesto’s guidance to keep things simple.

### What Kills High-Performance Teams?

__Pitfall #1:__ Conflicts are not managed effectively; it is important to regularly remind the Agile Team of the value of respectfully discussing differing opinions and suggestions.

__Pitfall #2:__ Blame game begins; there needs to be a tolerance for some failures since Agile Teams work in fast-paced situations. Such blame games and negative criticism quickly escalate to unhealthy conflict. The smarter and healthier outlook is to continue to keep the Agile Team on a learning mindset.

__Pitfall#3:__ Rules of Engagement are not followed; the Facilitator must ensure the Agile Team honors the agreed-upon rules of engagement and that team communications are frequent and relevant to avoid a high performing Agile Team from commencing its decline.

__Pitfall #4:__ Spark or passion is dimmed; if the Agile Team starts to perceive that their work is not as valuable, it can annihilate motivation. When this starts to get foggy, the Product Owner needs to quickly step in the clarify.
