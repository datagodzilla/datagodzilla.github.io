### Introduction

Agile Governance under the umbrella of Agile Manifesto promotes light and simple governance structure. The Agile Manifesto is where we get the four (4) paired values and twelve (12) principles that guide Agile teams. The Agile Manifesto really can help guide us to better software development and can be used in non-software teams as well.

### Agile Manifesto 

1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.

3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.

8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

10. Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.

11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts
its behavior accordingly.

### Agile Governance

Effective Agile Governance is about making decisions.
In order to enable effective Agile governance, the following needs to be kept in mind:

- Tolerances are essential for Agile Governance.
- Decentralized decision making empowers the team. This is critical for teams to:
    - Openly communicate and resolve conflicts 
    - Promote constructive debates on issues
    - Help quick resolution of issues
    - All team members commit to decisions and work collectively towards the project goals
- Agile Governance delivers goodwill and trust.
    - When done right, agile governance provides clarity on roles and responsibilities of team members
    - Thresholds and tolerances for decentralized decisions
- Agile promotes light and simple governance.
    - Team members decide on transparent metrics to leverage on self-monitoring the progress of the project 
    - Assessment of progress is determined through observation and engagement of team members rather than reports and documents
- Strategic and long-term Decisions remain centralized.
    - The choice of centralized vs decentralized decision making on issues remain on the following criteria:
        - Centralized decision making
            - Decisions that span a longer time frame
            - Decisions that have an organization-wide impact
            - Rare decisions that require deeper analysis
        - Decentralized decision making
            - To address regular or frequent decisions
            - Time critical decisions that should not be delayed due to significant costs
            - Need specific local or team level information or context for problem solving
- Effective Agile governance ensures decisions are made in a simpler and lighter manner per the Agile Manifestoâ€™s guidance to keep things simple.

### What Kills High-Performance Teams?

__Pitfall #1:__ Conflicts are not managed effectively; it is important to regularly remind the Agile Team of the value of respectfully discussing differing opinions and suggestions.

__Pitfall #2:__ Blame game begins; there needs to be a tolerance for some failures since Agile Teams work in fast-paced situations. Such blame games and negative criticism quickly escalate to unhealthy conflict. The smarter and healthier outlook is to continue to keep the Agile Team on a learning mindset.

__Pitfall#3:__ Rules of Engagement are not followed; the Facilitator must ensure the Agile Team honors the agreed-upon rules of engagement and that team communications are frequent and relevant to avoid a high performing Agile Team from commencing its decline.

__Pitfall #4:__ Spark or passion is dimmed; if the Agile Team starts to perceive that their work is not as valuable, it can annihilate motivation. When this starts to get foggy, the Product Owner needs to quickly step in the clarify.
